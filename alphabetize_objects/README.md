# Application Opener
## Overview:

This is a script I use to alphabetize objects.

## Why would you find that useful?

When organizing things at home and submitting things at school, the objects must be in alphabetical order, and I never want to do this in my head. So I made a script which will do it for me.

## How would you setup this script?

1. You can copy this code and paste it in an online java compiler. I prefer repl.it or tutorialspoint compiler
